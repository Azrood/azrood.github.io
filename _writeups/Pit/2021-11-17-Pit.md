# Writeup

## Enumeration
nmap enumeration:
```nmap
* 22/tcp   open  ssh             syn-ack ttl 63 OpenSSH 8.0 (protocol 2.0)
* 80/tcp   open  http            syn-ack ttl 63 nginx 1.14.1
* 9090/tcp open  ssl/zeus-admin? syn-ack ttl 63
	 ssl-cert: Subject: commonName=dms-pit.htb/ organizationName=4cd9329523184b0ea52ba0d20a1a6f92/countryName=US
	 Subject Alternative Name: DNS:dms-pit.htb, DNS:localhost, IP Address:127.0.0.1

```
We add the `dms-pit.htb` to `/etc/hosts` just in case there is virtual host.

Port 80 doesn't have anything interesting, Port 9090 has a login page, Hydra can't seem to bruteforce it, after launching nmap scan of UDP we find open port 161. This port corresponds to SNMP, it's a protocol.

### SNMP
Download and install `snmp-mibs-downloader` (apt)

To enumerate fully, we start walking the tree with `snmpwalk`
**Notes** :  `snmpwalk` by default starts from "mib-2", so you should specify `1` or `iso` to start enumerating from the root tree.

`snmpwalk -v 1 -c public 10.10.10.241 1`

## Foothold
We notice this path
![Pasted image 20210712230908.png](../Pasted%20image%2020210712230908.png)
Trying to access https://pit.htb:9090/seeddms51x/seeddms doesn't work.
While https://dms-pit.htb/ gives a forbidden error, we can access the URL https://dms-pit.htb/seeddms51x/seeddms

![Pasted image 20210712231031.png](../Pasted%20image%2020210712231031.png)

Since we saw the user `michelle` when enumrating SNMP, I try `michelle: michelle`, and it works.
We can login
![Pasted image 20210712231359.png](../Pasted%20image%2020210712231359.png)

There is upgrade note posted by Admin
![Pasted image 20210712231451.png](../Pasted%20image%2020210712231451.png)

We download the attachment, nothing really interesting except an old CVE fix about unvalidated file upload. We read about the CVE in exploit-db.

We see there is default folder for uploaded files
```txt
data/1048576/<document_id>/<file>.php
```

We see in the docs folder a folder named "Michelle" let's see if we can upload a php webshell.
![Pasted image 20210712232540.png](../Pasted%20image%2020210712232540.png)

We add a document
![Pasted image 20210712232926.png](../Pasted%20image%2020210712232926.png)
![Pasted image 20210712233520.png](../Pasted%20image%2020210712233520.png)

We setup our netcat listener
![Pasted image 20210712232945.png](../Pasted%20image%2020210712232945.png)

And we access the path
`dms-pit.htb/seeddms51x/data/1048576/<document_id>/<file>`
(We see our document_id is 30, you can see it in the URL as parameter, and the \<file\> is the name you specified in the form)

We have a shell, and we go to /var/www/html/conf

we see a file `settings.xml`
let's print it
We find some database creds
![Pasted image 20210713002133.png](../Pasted%20image%2020210713002133.png)
```xml
<database dbDriver="mysql" dbHostname="localhost" dbDatabase="seeddms" dbUser="seeddms" dbPass="ied^ieY6xoquu">
```

Let's try these creds in the main page at port 9090
Didnt work.

Let's try `Michelle: ied^ieY6xoquu`
It works !
We have these options
![Pasted image 20210713004107.png](../Pasted%20image%2020210713004107.png)
And in the profile we see
![Pasted image 20210713004134.png](../Pasted%20image%2020210713004134.png)
Hmmm interesting.
Further down the road in the left bar we see a Terminal
![Pasted image 20210713004256.png](../Pasted%20image%2020210713004256.png)

![Pasted image 20210713004306.png](../Pasted%20image%2020210713004306.png)
Nice ! We can get user flag .

## Priv Esc
We grep in the output of snmpwalk for `root`, we see there is a user root part of the OID
`NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendOutLine."monitoring"`
Let's fetch all of this MIB module with `nsExtendObjects`

* [OID viewer](https://cric.grenoble.cnrs.fr/Administrateurs/Outils/MIBS/?oid=1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.1.3)

We see there is a binary `/usr/bin/monitor`
in the OID `NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendCommand."monitoring"`
![Pasted image 20210713032341.png](../Pasted%20image%2020210713032341.png)
Let's check it from Michelle

![Pasted image 20210713032323.png](../Pasted%20image%2020210713032323.png)
It's a script shell.

![Pasted image 20210713032423.png](../Pasted%20image%2020210713032423.png)

So what it does is iterate in the folder `/usr/local/monitoring/` for files that start with `check` and end with `sh`, so `check*sh`
and execute them with bash. And seeing the permissions, it is ran as root. So we can get a root shell.

Unfortonately we can't use a reverse shell, because there is a firewall iptables that is blocking the connection. So we can rely on ssh, we will create ou ssh key, and create a script that will copy the ssh key to the `/root/.ssh` folder and we will use that key to connect to root through ssh.

Fortunately we can write in `/usr/local/monitoring/`

let's generate a ssh key in our kali machine
`ssh-keygen`
![Pasted image 20210713032955.png](../Pasted%20image%2020210713032955.png)

And the script `check1.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "<PASTE HERE THE CONTENT OF id_rsa.pub>" > /root/.ssh/authorized_keys 
```

We copy this script by uploading it with curl and setting up our Python HTTP Server.

To trigger the `monitor` script to run our script, we can execute it with snmpwalk by querying its specific OID and querying the `run_on_read()`

`NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendRunType."monitoring" = INTEGER: run-on-read(1)
`
See [SNMP RCE](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/pentesting-snmp/snmp-rce)
Command :
* `snmpwalk -c public -v 1 10.10.10.241 nsExtendObject`

Then run `ssh root@10.10.10.241 -i id_rsa`
You have root, you can get the flag :)
